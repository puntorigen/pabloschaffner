<Section title="The Challenge" badge="Context" color="purple">

AI marketing tools in 2024 are fragmented—one tool for copywriting, another for images, another for video. Each with different UI, pricing, and quality levels.

**What marketing agencies actually need:**
- Unified platform for all creative AI tasks
- Consistent quality across different AI models
- Fast iteration on client work
- Scalable deployment for multiple clients

**The approach:** Build a modular platform that can deploy specialized apps quickly.

<Section title="What I Built" badge="Architecture" color="blue">

**FenixBlack.ai** - AI marketing agency platform with 7 production applications shipped in 4 months (2024).

**Main Platform** (Python + NiceGUI):
- **Interactive video avatars** for client presentations
- **AI brand designer** for complete brand identities
- **Research agents** for market analysis
- **Custom React bridge** - novel integration allowing React components in Python apps

**6 Specialized Micro-Apps** (Next.js):
1. **brand.fenixblack.ai** - Complete brand kit generation
2. **backgrounds.fenixblack.ai** - Zoom/Teams background creator
3. **holidays.fenixblack.ai** - Animated holiday video generator
4. **restore.fenixblack.ai** - AI photo restoration & animation
5. **canvas.fenixblack.ai** - Hand-drawn animation generator
6. **growth.fenixblack.ai** - Credit and usage management

<Section title="Technical Innovation" badge="Custom Bridge" color="orange">

The hardest problem wasn't integrating AI models—it was building a Python backend that could render modern React UIs.

**The challenge:** NiceGUI (Python UI framework) is great for AI prototyping but limited for complex interactions. React has the components I needed but doesn't integrate with Python backends naturally.

**The solution:** Built a custom **React-Python bridge** that:
- Renders React components inside Python applications
- Maintains Python's rapid AI integration capabilities
- Keeps React's modern UI/UX patterns
- Enables real-time bidirectional communication

This isn't a library—it's a custom architecture I designed specifically for this use case.

**Result:** Rapid AI workflow development with production-quality UI.

<Section title="Multi-App Strategy" badge="Deployment" color="green">

Instead of one monolithic application, built **6 independent micro-apps** on Vercel.

**Why this works:**
- **Faster iteration** - Update one app without touching others
- **Specialized marketing** - Each app has its own landing page and SEO
- **Independent scaling** - High-traffic apps don't impact others
- **Easier pricing** - Customers can buy just what they need

**Stack per micro-app:**
- Next.js 14 for performance and SEO
- Vercel for instant global deployment
- Different AI models per use case (OpenAI, Stable Diffusion, FFmpeg)
- Shared authentication and credit system

<Section title="Development Timeline" badge="4 Months" color="cyan">

**Month 1:** Main platform architecture + React bridge
**Month 2:** First 3 micro-apps (brand, backgrounds, holidays)
**Month 3:** Remaining 3 micro-apps (restore, canvas, growth)
**Month 4:** Integration, testing, production deployment

**How I shipped 7 apps in 4 months:**
- Shared component library across all Next.js apps
- Standardized deployment pipeline (Vercel)
- Reusable AI integration patterns
- Focused on MVP features first, polish later

**Key insight:** Micro-apps let you ship incrementally. Each app was usable on day one of its development.

<Stats items={[
  { label: "Total Apps", value: "7 apps" },
  { label: "Build Time", value: "4 months" },
  { label: "Tech Innovation", value: "React Bridge" },
  { label: "Deployment", value: "Global Edge" }
]} />

**Current status:**
- All 7 apps in production
- Multiple AI models integrated (OpenAI, Stable Diffusion, etc.)
- Custom React-Python bridge working in production
- Independent deployment and scaling per app

**What this proves:**
- Multi-app platforms **can** ship fast
- Python + React **can** work together elegantly
- Complex AI integrations **can** be standardized
- Micro-services architecture **works** for AI products

<Section title="What I Learned" badge="Insights" color="teal">

**On polyglot development:**
Don't fight your tools. Python is best for AI integration, React is best for modern UI. Building a bridge between them was faster than fighting either's limitations.

**On multi-app platforms:**
Splitting into micro-apps was the right call. Development complexity goes up slightly, but deployment flexibility and iteration speed go up dramatically.

**On AI model integration:**
Every AI model has quirks. OpenAI for text, Stable Diffusion for images, FFmpeg for video—use the right tool for each job, then abstract the complexity away from users.
