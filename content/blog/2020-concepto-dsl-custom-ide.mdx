<Section title="The Problem" badge="Context" color="blue">

Most IDEs force you to think in syntax, not concepts. I needed something different—a way to go from idea to production code without losing the mental model.

**The solution:** Build a custom IDE that uses mindmaps as the programming interface.

In **2007**, I forked **Freemind** and built **Concepto**—a visual programming environment where mindmap nodes compile directly into working applications. No traditional code writing required.

**Why mindmaps?** They're how humans naturally organize complex information. Non-linear, visual, easy to refactor. Perfect for representing both application structure and logic flow.

<Section title="First Production Use" badge="2007-2008" color="purple">

**The test:** Could this approach ship real products for paying clients?

Built the first version for creating mobile websites in my Creador WAP framework. Drew concepts in a mindmap, hit compile, deployed to production.

**Year one results:**
- **100+ mobile websites** shipped to production
- Clients: **Discovery Networks**, **Movistar**, **Sony**
- Zero traditional code written
- Development speed: **10x faster** than conventional approach

The breakthrough wasn't just speed—it was maintaining **conceptual clarity** from idea through deployment. The mindmap you saw was the actual source code.

<Section title="Scaling the Approach" badge="Company" color="green">

Founded **Creador S.A.** to productize Concepto. Initial plan: sell licenses to developers.

**Reality check:** Everyone loved the demo. Nobody bought licenses.

**Pivot:** Use Concepto as our competitive advantage. Build client products faster than traditional agencies.

**Result:** Ran Creador for **13 years** as CEO, powered entirely by this custom toolchain. The IDE wasn't the product—it was the **engine** that made everything else possible.

<Section title="Multi-Platform Code Generation" badge="Architecture" color="orange">

The real power wasn't mobile websites—it was the **compiler architecture** that could target any platform.

**The approach:** Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) for each target platform. Same mindmap, different output.

**Platform expansion:**
- **J2ME/Nokia** → MoSync (C++)
- **Web apps** → qooxdoo framework
- **Mobile apps** → Appcelerator Titanium, native Swift/Java
- **Backend services** → Node.js, ColdFusion, Ruby

One visual model. Ten different compilation targets. Write once, deploy everywhere—actually delivered.

<TechStack items={["Java", "Freemind", "MoSync", "Appcelerator", "Swift", "Node.js", "ColdFusion", "Ruby"]} />

**Key insight:** The abstraction layer wasn't the problem—most visual programming tools fail because they try to be general-purpose. Concepto was **opinionated** about architecture patterns, which made it faster to use.

<Section title="Production Applications" badge="Real Products" color="indigo">

These aren't prototypes. These are production apps that shipped to app stores and served real users—all generated from mindmaps.

**Total output:** 100+ mobile applications shipped across Latin America. All compiled from the same IDE.

<Section title="What I Learned" badge="Insights" color="cyan">

**Visual programming can work—but only with constraints.**

Most visual programming tools fail because they try to recreate traditional programming visually. That's backwards.

**What worked:**
- **Opinionated architecture** - Concepto enforced patterns, not just syntax
- **Domain-specific** - Each DSL was purpose-built for its target
- **Concept-first** - Think in business logic, not implementation details
- **Iteration speed** - See changes immediately, no compile-wait-debug loop

**The real value:** Maintaining the **mental model** from conception through deployment. No context switching between "what I want" and "how to code it."

This approach made me and my team incredibly productive. Development speed wasn't just faster—it was fundamentally different.

**What this proves:**
- Built a complete custom IDE that **powered a company** for over a decade
- Generated **production-quality code** across wildly different platforms
- Visual, concept-driven development **works at scale**
- Achieved **10x productivity gains** compared to traditional development

**The takeaway:** Don't accept tool limitations. If existing IDEs don't match how you think, **build your own**.

If you're building **developer tools**, **code generation systems**, or **domain-specific languages**, I can help.

I've built production compilers, designed DSLs, and shipped systems that generated millions of lines of working code. I understand the complexities of abstraction layers, multi-target compilation, and building tools that developers actually want to use.
