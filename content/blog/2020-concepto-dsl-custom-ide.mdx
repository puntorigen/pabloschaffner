<Section title="The Origin Story" badge="2007" color="blue">

**The idea:** What if I could transform mindmaps directly into working code?

I had been using mindmaps for organizing ideas for years. Their non-linear structure made it easy to gather concepts, add attributes, move notes around, and see the big picture.

In **2007**, I made my first attempt—forking the open-source **Freemind** software and modifying it extensively to create what I called **Concepto**.

<Section title="Concepto WAP: The First Version" badge="Mobile Websites" color="purple">

**Goal:** Create mobile websites for my Creador WAP framework using Spanish concepts represented in mindmaps.

The first version was simple—just for creating mobile websites—but it worked perfectly. It represented both:
- Design structure
- Code flow

Something I haven't been able to replicate in any other IDE software.

**Results:**
- Made **100+ mobile websites in one year** using Concepto
- Clients included: **Discovery Networks**, **Movistar**, **Sony**, and many others

The important thing wasn't just the resulting code, but the **subtle flow transition from the requirement of the mind to the representation into a product**.

<Section title="Founding Creador S.A." badge="The Company">

When I founded **Creador S.A.**, my first intention was to rent or sell licenses of Concepto to other developers.

**The Reality:**
- Everyone I showed it to loved it
- Many people wanted to acquire it
- But none wanted to pay for it

We were too ahead of our time for the Chilean market. So instead of renting our tools, we started **using them to create products for our clients**.

<Section title="Evolution to Concepto DSL" badge="Multi-Platform">

To showcase that Concepto was more than just a tool for mobile websites, I evolved it to support multiple code generators.

**Concepto WAP → Concepto DSL**

I called the process of abstracting programming language concepts into mindmap representation a **"DSL"** (Domain Specific Language syntax) for the Creador framework.

**First Native Apps:**
- Platform: **J2ME** (Nokia devices)
- Framework: **MoSync** (C++ code)
- Result: Diagram your programming, get the product on a Nokia device

**Expansion to Multiple Targets:**

As Creador grew, we added DSLs for:
- **Webapps:** qooxdoo (Windows-looking webapps)
- **Semi-native mobile apps:** Appcelerator Titanium
- **Native mobile apps:** Swift (iOS), Java (Android)
- **Backend services:** ColdFusion, Node.js, Ruby

<Section title="Real Apps Built with Concepto DSL" badge="Production">

**Sample Mobile Apps Created:**

1. **HoroscopOH!** - Horoscope app (iOS + Android)
2. **Medcam** - Medical image recognition app (iOS)
3. **Ayni** - Community assistance app (iOS + Android)
4. **Transvictoria Taxis** - Taxi booking app (iOS + Android)

Plus **100+ other mobile applications** for companies across Latin America.

<Section title="The Philosophy" badge="Why It Matters">

**"If you like to use your product, it's probably going to be loved by others like you."**

Concepto DSL represents a **new way of thinking about development** without losing focus on the app's intention or goal.

**Key Innovation:**
- Think in concepts, not code syntax
- Visual representation of both structure and flow
- Automatic code generation for multiple platforms
- From idea to product with minimal friction

I'm still very convinced this way of working is something good and unique. It was incredibly productive for me and those working with me.

Built a complete custom IDE from scratch that:
- Powered an entire software company for 13+ years
- Generated production code for multiple platforms
- Represented a fundamentally different approach to programming
- Proved that visual, concept-driven development could work at scale
