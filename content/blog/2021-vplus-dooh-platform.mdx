<Section title="The Market Opportunity" badge="Context" color="purple">

Out-of-home (OOH) advertising is a $30B+ market, but traditional billboards are static, expensive, and hard to measure.

**The insight:** Cars spend hours in traffic. Those rear windows are premium advertising real estate going unused.

**The challenge:** Build a platform that turns private vehicles into mobile billboards—but make it easy enough that drivers actually want to participate.

<Section title="The Company" badge="V+ Publicidad" color="blue">

**Founded V+ Publicidad** in Santiago, Chile (2019-2021) as co-founder and sole technical lead.

**Business model:**
- Drivers install our IoT display devices on rear windows
- Platform serves targeted ads based on location, time, and traffic patterns
- Drivers earn passive income per impression
- Advertisers get mobile, measurable, geo-targeted campaigns

**My role:** Founder & Principal Engineer. Built the entire technical stack from IoT firmware to cloud infrastructure.

Think Uber meets Waze Ads—but I built all the technology myself.

<Section title="Hardware: IoT Displays" badge="Devices" color="orange">

The hardest part wasn't software—it was building reliable IoT devices that could survive Chilean traffic for 8+ hours daily.

**Technical challenges:**
- **Power management** - Operate all day without draining car battery
- **Brightness** - Visible in Santiago sunlight (intense)
- **Durability** - Withstand heat, vibration, theft attempts
- **Connectivity** - 4G connection while moving through tunnels
- **Updates** - Remote firmware deployment to devices in the field

**Stack:**
- **Android-based displays** - Custom ROM for advertising
- **Device firmware** - C for low-level control, Python for logic, Java for Android layer
- **Real-time sync** - WebSocket connection to ad server
- **Offline mode** - Cache ads for connectivity gaps

**Result:** Devices that "just worked" for drivers. Install once, earn forever.

<Section title="Software: Three Platforms" badge="Full-Stack" color="green">

Built three complete applications as sole developer:

**1. Web Platform (Vue.js / Nuxt.js)**
For advertisers and agencies:
- Campaign creation with geo-targeting
- Real-time analytics dashboard
- Billing and payment processing
- Ad creative upload and approval workflow
- Map visualization of active vehicles

**2. Mobile App (React Native)**
For drivers:
- Onboarding and KYC verification
- Device pairing via Bluetooth
- Real-time earnings tracking
- Payment withdrawals
- Support system

**3. Admin Portal (Vue.js)**
Internal ops tools:
- Device management and diagnostics
- Driver approval workflow
- Ad content moderation
- Financial reporting

<Section title="Infrastructure: Real-Time at Scale" badge="AWS" color="cyan">

**The challenge:** Serve different ads to hundreds of moving vehicles simultaneously based on their current location.

**Architecture:**
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** - Web application hosting
- **AWS Lambda** - Serverless ad matching algorithm
- **AuroraDB (PostgreSQL)** - Relational data (users, campaigns, transactions)
- **DynamoDB** - Real-time device state and location
- **S3 + CloudFront** - Ad creative CDN for fast delivery
- **Route 53** - DNS and traffic management
- **WebSockets** - Real-time device communication

**Performance requirements:**
- Sub-second ad delivery to moving devices
- Handle 1000+ concurrent device connections
- Geo-query optimization for location-based targeting
- 99.9% uptime for driver earnings

**Result:** System handled peak traffic hours without issues. Drivers never missed ad revenue due to tech failures.

<Section title="What Made This Hard" badge="Challenges" color="indigo">

**Hardware + Software integration:**
Most startups are software-only. We had to solve device manufacturing, supply chain, installation logistics, AND build the platform.

**Real-time at scale:**
Serving ads to moving vehicles with sub-second latency while they pass through tunnels, change lanes, and experience variable connectivity.

**Multi-sided marketplace:**
Had to build and balance three experiences: advertisers (create campaigns), drivers (earn money), and admins (ops tools).

**Regulatory uncertainty:**
D-OOH advertising in Chile had no clear regulations. Had to navigate municipal permits, transit authority approvals, and advertising standards boards.

**Technical achievements:**
- Built IoT devices from scratch that operated reliably in field conditions
- Deployed real-time ad serving platform handling 1000+ concurrent devices
- Developed three production applications as sole technical lead
- Integrated hardware, software, and cloud infrastructure into cohesive system

**Business outcomes:**
- Launched in Santiago with initial driver fleet
- Secured paying advertisers for pilot campaigns
- Validated technical feasibility of mobile D-OOH concept
- Gained deep expertise in IoT, real-time systems, and startup operations

**What I learned:**
Founding a hardware+software startup is 10x harder than pure software. But the competitive moat is also 10x stronger—nobody can clone IoT devices as easily as they can clone apps.
