<Section title="The Problem" badge="Lost Code" color="purple">

A potential client reached out with a common disaster scenario: they had a production Android app built by a freelance developer, but **no source code**. The developer was gone. The app needed updates.

**Their question:** Can you recover the source code from the APK?

**My answer:** Let me find out.

The app was built with **Appcelerator Titanium**—a framework I knew well since I was actively building compilers that generated Titanium code. This wasn't just a client problem anymore—it was a technical challenge I wanted to solve.

<Section title="Understanding APK Structure" badge="Research" color="blue">

APKs are essentially ZIP files with a specific structure. Any Android developer knows you can unpack them with the right tools.

**Standard APK contents:**
- `resources.arsc` - Compiled resources
- `classes.dex` - Dalvik bytecode (Java classes)
- `AndroidManifest.xml` - Binary manifest
- Assets folder - Images, sounds, fonts, layouts

**Standard reverse engineering tools:**
- **apktool** - Extracts assets and decrypts manifests
- **dex2jar** - Converts DEX to JAR format
- **JD/JADx** - Decompiles Java classes back to source

But Titanium apps are different. They market themselves as "JavaScript compiled to native"—which means the JS code isn't sitting in the resources folder like Ionic apps.

**The question:** Where is Titanium hiding the source code?

</Section>

<Section title="Building the Tool Chain" badge="Development" color="orange">

I needed custom tooling. No existing solution did what I needed, so I built three npm packages.

### 1. APK_unpack - Resource Extraction

**Problem:** Existing APK tools are CLI-based and clunky for automation.

**Solution:** Built a Node.js package that wraps apktool with a Java bridge for one-step resource extraction.

**Challenge:** This was my first Node.js app consuming Java classes directly. Interesting integration problem.

**NPM:** [apk_unpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apk_unpack)

### 2. ti_unpack - Titanium Code Extraction

**Problem:** Where does Titanium store the JavaScript source in compiled APKs?

**Research:** Found a SlideShare presentation ("Help Doctor, My Application is an Onion") explaining that Titanium code lives in a file called `AssetCryptImpl` in the main package directory.

**Solution:** Built a JavaScript unpacker that extracts and decrypts Titanium's encrypted asset bundle.

**Result:** Successfully extracted the entire app's source code into memory!

**GitHub:** [ti_unpack](https://github.com/creador/ti_unpack)

### 3. ti_recover - Project Structure Restoration

**Problem:** Having the code in memory isn't enough—developers need the original project structure.

**Challenge:** Different Titanium versions minify code differently. I needed to reverse that.

**Solution:** Built a recovery tool that reconstructs proper Titanium project structure from the extracted code.

**Result:** Complete, working Titanium project ready for development.

**NPM:** [ti_recover](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ti_recover)

<Section title="What I Learned" badge="Insights" color="green">

**On code security:**
This frightened me. I had published **dozens of Titanium apps** to app stores. Now I knew exactly how recoverable they were.

**On obfuscation vs encryption:**
Titanium's "encrypted" assets are really just obfuscated. With the right tools and understanding of the format, recovery is straightforward.

**On protecting intellectual property:**
If source code protection is critical, compilation to native bytecode isn't enough. Real encryption or server-side logic is necessary.

**On framework transparency:**
Titanium is a great product—this isn't criticism. But developers should understand how their framework actually packages and protects (or doesn't protect) their code.

**The positive side:**
Sometimes you **need** to recover source code. Lost contractors, corrupted drives, missing backups—it happens. Now I know recovery is possible.

**Who benefits:**
- Developers who lost Titanium source code
- Security researchers analyzing Titanium apps
- Companies with contractor code recovery needs
- Anyone curious about Titanium's internals

**Published packages:**
- `apk_unpack` - General APK resource extraction
- `ti_unpack` - Titanium code extraction
- `ti_recover` - Full project restoration

**Real-world usage:**
I've seen this problem multiple times on Quora and Stack Overflow. These tools solve a real need in the Titanium community.

<Section title="The Takeaway" badge="Lessons" color="indigo">

**On reverse engineering:**
Most mobile frameworks can be reversed with enough understanding of their architecture. "Compiled to native" often means "compiled to something that can be decompiled."

**On building tools:**
When you hit a problem that existing tools don't solve, build the tool. I needed this for one client—ended up creating value for the entire Titanium community.

**On code ownership:**
Always maintain source control. Always have backups. Always ensure contractors deliver source code. But if you lose it—recovery might still be possible.

<Section title="Technical Details" badge="For Engineers" color="teal">

**How Titanium packages JavaScript:**

1. **Compilation phase**: JS → Native bindings
2. **Encryption phase**: JS bundled into `AssetCryptImpl`
3. **Packaging phase**: Everything compressed into APK

**The recovery process:**

1. **Unzip APK** → Access internal structure
2. **Extract AssetCryptImpl** → Get encrypted bundle
3. **Decrypt bundle** → Recover JavaScript source
4. **Parse structure** → Rebuild project files
5. **Restore project** → Working Titanium app

**Key insight:**
The encryption is reversible because the decryption key must be embedded in the app itself (otherwise the app couldn't run). This is a fundamental limitation of client-side "encryption."

<Section title="Use This Knowledge Responsibly" badge="Ethics" color="rose">

These tools exist for **legitimate recovery purposes**:
- Recovering your own lost source code
- Security research and auditing
- Educational understanding of framework internals

**Not for:**
- Stealing others' intellectual property
- Reverse engineering to clone apps
- Violating software licenses

With great power comes great responsibility. I built these tools to help developers in genuine need—not to enable theft.
