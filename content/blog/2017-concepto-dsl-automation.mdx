<Section title="The Problem" badge="Challenge" color="red">

I was translating Concepto DSL commands from Spanish to English. The manual way.

After translating the first few commands, reality hit: **100+ commands to translate**, each with documentation, autocomplete definitions, and validation rules. At my current pace, this would take **a full month** of tedious, error-prone work.

There had to be a better way.

</Section>

<Section title="The Insight" badge="Discovery" color="blue">

Titanium is a JavaScript framework. All its APIs are documented in English. **I was recreating documentation that already existed.**

If I could tap into Titanium's own documentation format, I could automate the entire process.

**The file:** `api.jsca` - Appcelerator's complete API specification. A 36MB JSON file at the root of every Titanium SDK. This file powers the autocomplete in their official IDE.

Appcelerator even encourages developers to use it. Perfect.

</Section>

<Section title="The Challenge" badge="Technical" color="orange">

**Problem 1: Size**

36MB of JSON data. Parsing this in real-time would kill performance. I needed a lighter format.

**Problem 2: Structure**

Titanium's API structure didn't match Concepto's DSL patterns. I needed to map between two different paradigms:
- Titanium thinks in objects and methods
- Concepto thinks in visual nodes and attributes

**Problem 3: Completeness**

The API file had everything—but also missing pieces. Events, conditionals, and scripting patterns weren't in `api.jsca`. I'd need to add those separately.

</Section>

<Section title="Finding the Solution" badge="Research" color="green">

I found a GitHub user named **yomybaby** who'd already solved the parsing problem. He'd built Titanium autocomplete for Atom.io using a condensed version of `api.jsca`.

His approach:
- Parse the 36MB file once
- Extract only what's needed for autocomplete
- Generate a 1MB `ti-completions.json` file

**Perfect.** I could adapt this to ColdFusion (Concepto's native language) and use it to auto-generate DSL commands.

  problem="Manually creating DSL commands for 100+ Titanium APIs would take a month."
  solution="Built a parser that reads Titanium's api.jsca and auto-generates Concepto DSL command definitions."
  result="Reduced 36MB API file to 1MB, then auto-generated 380 pages of documentation in 4 days instead of 1 month."

</Section>

<Section title="The Architecture" badge="Implementation" color="purple">

I created a method called `ac_ti()` that bridges Titanium's API structure with Concepto's DSL format:

**What it does:**

1. **Reads** the condensed API file (1MB instead of 36MB)
2. **Matches** Titanium objects to Concepto command patterns
3. **Generates** duplicate commands for each API variation
4. **Maps** attribute values to Concepto's node system
5. **Exports** documentation and autocomplete definitions

**Example:**

For every Titanium view (Label, Button, ImageView, etc.), `ac_ti()` creates:
- A Concepto command with proper syntax
- Documentation with all properties, events, and methods
- Autocomplete hints with type checking
- Value aliases (e.g., `*` → `Ti.UI.FILL`, `-` → `Ti.UI.SIZE`)
- Real-time code update handlers for Live Mode

**Key features:**

- **Auto-updated:** New SDK release? Re-run the parser. Done.
- **Deprecated handling:** Automatically marks deprecated methods
- **Consistent:** Every command follows the same pattern
- **Documented:** 380-page manual generated automatically

</Section>

<Section title="Results" badge="Impact" color="cyan">

**Before:**
- 100+ commands to translate manually
- 1 month estimated time
- Prone to errors and inconsistencies
- Manual updates for each SDK version

**After:**
- All commands auto-generated in 4 days
- 380 pages of documentation (vs. ~100 before)
- Automatic SDK updates
- Consistent structure across all commands
- Autocomplete support for entire Titanium API

**What's left:**

The English DSL wasn't production-ready yet. I still needed to add:
- Event handlers (onClick, onChange, etc.)
- Conditionals (if/else logic)
- Control flow (loops, switches)
- Scripting commands (not in api.jsca)

But the foundation was solid. The tedious part was automated.

<Section title="What I Learned" badge="Insights" color="indigo">

**On automation:**

When you find yourself doing repetitive work, stop. Look for the pattern. Can it be automated? In this case, 4 days of automation work saved me 26 days of manual work—and made the system more maintainable.

**On leveraging existing tools:**

I didn't invent the parsing strategy. I found yomybaby's solution and adapted it. Good developers don't reinvent wheels—they find the right wheels and connect them to their own systems.

**On DSL design:**

A well-designed DSL shouldn't just parse code—it should be self-documenting. The `ac_ti()` approach meant every command automatically generated its own documentation, autocomplete, and validation rules.

**On perfection vs. progress:**

The English DSL wasn't complete after 4 days. Events and conditionals were missing. But I had the core working. Ship the foundation, iterate on the details.

<Section title="The Bigger Picture" badge="Context" color="yellow">

This was part of building **Concepto DSL**, a visual programming environment that compiled mindmap-like diagrams into working Titanium mobile apps.

The challenge: Titanium's API is huge and constantly evolving. Manual documentation was unsustainable.

The solution: Automate everything that can be automated. Use the framework's own documentation as the source of truth.

This approach later became the template for how Concepto handled **all** its DSL extensions—not just Titanium, but Vue.js, React, and Node.js backends too.

**The lesson:** Don't fight your dependencies. Embrace them. If Titanium documents their API in `api.jsca`, use `api.jsca`. If they update it, your system updates too.

</Section>

<Section title="Use This Approach" badge="Resources" color="pink">

**If you're building a DSL or code generator:**

1. **Find the spec:** Most frameworks have machine-readable API specs (JSON, XML, TypeScript definitions)
2. **Parse once, generate many:** Convert the spec to your internal format once
3. **Automate documentation:** If your code is auto-generated, your docs should be too
4. **Handle deprecation:** Good specs mark deprecated features—use that info
5. **Version appropriately:** Tie your generator to specific framework versions

**Tools that inspired this:**

- [Titanium API Docs](https://docs.appcelerator.com/) - The source of truth
- [yomybaby's Atom Titanium](https://github.com/yomybaby/atom-titanium) - The parsing inspiration
- [api.jsca spec](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/apidoc/api.jsca) - The format itself

**Related tools:**

If you're building code generators, check out:
- TypeScript's `.d.ts` files for type definitions
- OpenAPI/Swagger specs for REST APIs
- GraphQL schemas for GraphQL APIs
- JSON Schema for data validation

All of these can power automated code and documentation generation.
